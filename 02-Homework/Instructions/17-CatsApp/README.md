* **Instructions**

  * Add a delete button next to each cat in the `cat-block.handlebars` file.

  * Add on to the following:

  * The `cats.js` file to add an event handler for the delete button.
  
  * The ORM to include a delete key and function.
  
  * The cat model to include a delete key and function that uses the ORM.
  
  * The `catsController.js` file to have a `/api/cats/:id` delete route, to call the delete key of the cat model, and to pass in arguments as necessary.
